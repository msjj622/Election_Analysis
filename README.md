#  Analysis of the Election Audit
## Overview of Election Audit: (Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.)
The purpose of this analysis is to know what months Theater got mostly successful in the fundraising goals and what amount of fundraising goals are mostly successful in the play sector. Since Louise knows that play Fever came close to this fundraising goal in a short period, She wanted to know how the play sector has a relationship with launch dates and the amount of funding goals. If we can provide the outcomes of what months got successful in Theater based on the launch dates and what amount of funding goals are mostly successful in the play sector, she can acknowledge what things made successful in funding and be used for future funding plans.

## Election-Audit Results: (Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.) 
(There is a bulleted list where each election outcome is addressed)

- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

- Which county had the largest number of votes?

- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

##Election-Audit Summary: 
(In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can 
be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can 
be modified to be used for other elections.) 
(There is a statement to the election commission that explores 
how this script can be used for any election, with two examples for modifying the script.) 






The first one is the months of May, jun and july are mostly successful in theater outcomes by launch date. It clearly shows that launch dates are close to summer, it seems mostly successful compared to fall and winter seasons. Secondly, according to the chart, December seems to overlap with success and failure. December is the lowest number of successes in theater outcomes by launch date. Half of them are successful and the other half are failed in a grand total, which means December is not a good lunch date for new projects.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Based on the chart, less than 1000 to 1000 to 4999 in the doller-amount range are mostly successful. People apt to fund the goal the first two doller-amount range in a play category.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

First of all, I only know 'play' sub category percentage of successful in the chart of outcomes based on goals. Also, I don't know what months of launch date of the successful projects in the chart of outcomes based on goals. I also think how to know if the successful percentage would be included with mostly successful months of launch date.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

First of all, we could create 'month' column in excel and create a graph of Theatre outcomes by Launch date based on months and 'play' subcategory, then we know more clearly what months of 'play' got mostly successful instead we used 'theater' in category. I would try to consistanly filter the same category or subcategory to create charts to make more clear data since we have category and subcategory.
